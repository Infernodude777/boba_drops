    <h1 class="heading">Into the Void</h1>
    Our game is about a man who corrects all of his wrong doings.
    <p>He starts his adventure by waking up in a graveyard. He has to fight off many spirits to survive. Little does he know, those are the past versions of himself doing bad things.
        <p>As he fights off the spirits, he picks up many items to aid him in battle.</p>
        <p>Once he beats all of the spirits, he reaches the afterlife, just like how in ancient Egyptian mythology, one must fight off spirits to reach the afterlife.</p>
